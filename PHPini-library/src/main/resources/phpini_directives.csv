allow_url_fopen;"1";bool;INI_SYSTEM;;"This option enables the URL-aware fopen wrappers that enable accessing URL object like files. Default wrappers are provided for the access of remote files using the ftp or http protocol, some extensions like zlib may register additional wrappers.";;
allow_url_include;"0";bool;INI_SYSTEM;"Deprecated as of PHP 7.4.0.";"This option allows the use of URL-aware fopen wrappers with the following functions: include, include_once, require, require_once.";;"7.4"

auto_append_file;null;string;INI_PERDIR;;"Specifies the name of a file that is automatically parsed after the main file. The file is included as if it was called with the require function, so include_path is used.";;
auto_detect_line_endings;"0";bool;INI_ALL;;"When turned on, PHP will examine the data read by fgets() and file() to see if it is using Unix, MS-Dos or Macintosh line-ending conventions.\n\nThis enables PHP to interoperate with Macintosh systems, but defaults to Off, as there is a very small performance penalty when detecting the EOL conventions for the first line, and also because people using carriage-returns as item separators under Unix systems would experience non-backwards-compatible behaviour.";;
auto_globals_jit;"1";bool;INI_PERDIR;;"When enabled, the SERVER, REQUEST, and ENV variables are created when they're first used (Just In Time) instead of when the script starts. If these variables are not used within a script, having this directive on will result in a performance gain.\n\nWarning\nUsage of SERVER, REQUEST, and ENV variables is checked during the compile time so using them through e.g. variable variables will not cause their initialization.";;
auto_prepend_file;null;string;INI_PERDIR;;"Specifies the name of a file that is automatically parsed before the main file. The file is included as if it was called with the require function, so include_path is used.\n\nThe special value none disables auto-prepending.";;

cgi.check_shebang_line;"1";bool;INI_SYSTEM;;"Controls whether CGI PHP checks for line starting with #! (shebang) at the top of the running script. This line might be needed if the script support running both as stand-alone script and via PHP CGI. PHP in CGI mode skips this line and ignores its content if this directive is turned on.";;
cgi.discard_path;"0";bool;INI_SYSTEM;;"If this is enabled, the PHP CGI binary can safely be placed outside of the web tree and people will not be able to circumvent .htaccess security.";;
cgi.fix_pathinfo;"1";bool;INI_SYSTEM;;"Provides real PATH_INFO/ PATH_TRANSLATED support for CGI. PHP's previous behaviour was to set PATH_TRANSLATED to SCRIPT_FILENAME, and to not grok what PATH_INFO is. For more information on PATH_INFO, see the CGI specs. Setting this to 1 will cause PHP CGI to fix its paths to conform to the spec. A setting of zero causes PHP to behave as before. It is turned on by default. You should fix your scripts to use SCRIPT_FILENAME rather than PATH_TRANSLATED.";;
cgi.force_redirect;"1";bool;INI_SYSTEM;;"cgi.force_redirect is necessary to provide security running PHP as a CGI under most web servers. Left undefined, PHP turns this on by default. You can turn it off at your own risk.";;
cgi.nph;"0";bool;INI_ALL;;"If cgi.nph is enabled it will force cgi to always sent Status: 200 with every request.";;
cgi.redirect_status_env;null;string;INI_SYSTEM;;"If cgi.force_redirect is turned on, and you are not running under Apache or Netscape (iPlanet) web servers, you may need to set an environment variable name that PHP will look for to know it is OK to continue execution.";;
cgi.rfc2616_headers;"0";bool;INI_ALL;;"If enabled, PHP will send the HTTP headers according to RFC2616. This means that the header 'Content-Type' will be sent before any other header. This is a requirement of the RFC.";;

com.allow_dcom;"0";bool;INI_SYSTEM;;"When this is turned on, PHP will be allowed to operate as a D-COM (Distributed COM) client and will allow the PHP script to instantiate COM objects on a remote server.";;
com.autoregister_typelib;"0";bool;INI_ALL;;"When this is turned on, PHP will attempt to register constants from the typelibrary of COM objects that it instantiates, if those objects implement the interfaces required to obtain that information. The case sensitivity of the constants it registers is controlled by the com.autoregister_casesensitive php.ini directive.";;
com.autoregister_verbose;"0";bool;INI_ALL;;"When this is turned on, any problems with loading a typelibrary during object instantiation will be reported using the PHP error mechanism. The default is off, which does not emit any indication if there was an error finding or loading the type library.";;
com.autoregister_casesensitive;"1";bool;INI_ALL;;"When this is turned on (the default), constants found in auto-loaded type libraries when instatiating COM objects will be registered case sensitively. See com_load_typelib() for more details.";;
com.code_page;"";string;INI_ALL;;"It controls the default character set code-page to use when passing strings to and from COM objects. If set to an empty string, PHP will assume that you want CP_ACP, which is the default system ANSI code page.\r\rIf the text in your scripts is encoded using a different encoding/character set by default, setting this directive will save you from having to pass the code page as a parameter to the com class constructor. Please note that by using this directive (as with any PHP configuration directive), your PHP script becomes less portable; you should use the COM constructor parameter whenever possible.";;
com.dotnet_version;"";string;INI_SYSTEM;"As of PHP 8.0.0";"The version of the .NET framework to use for dotnet objects. The value of the setting is the first three parts of the framework's version number, separated by dots, and prefixed with v, e.g. v4.0.30319.";8.0.0;
com.typelib_file;"";string;INI_SYSTEM;;"When set, this should hold the path to a file that contains a list of typelibraries that should be loaded on startup. Each line of the file will be treated as the type library name and loaded as though you had called com_load_typelib(). The constants will be registered persistently, so that the library only needs to be loaded once. If a type library name ends with the string #cis or #case_insensitive, then the constants from that library will be registered case insensitively.";;

See List of Supported Timezones for a list of supported timezones.";;

default_charset;"UTF-8";string;INI_ALL;;"'UTF-8' is the default value and its value is used as the default character encoding for htmlentities(), html_entity_decode() and htmlspecialchars() if the encoding parameter is omitted. The value of default_charset will also be used to set the default character set for iconv functions if the iconv.input_encoding, iconv.output_encoding and iconv.internal_encoding configuration options are unset, and for mbstring functions if the mbstring.http_input mbstring.http_output mbstring.internal_encoding configuration option is unset.\r\rAll versions of PHP will use this value as the charset within the default Content-Type header sent by PHP if the header isn't overridden by a call to header().\r\rSetting default_charset to an empty value is not recommended.";;
